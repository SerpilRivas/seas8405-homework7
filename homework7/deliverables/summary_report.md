*Serpil Rivas*  
*Date: May 16, 2025*
>### Introduction

This report documents the process and outcomes of hardening a vulnerable containerized Python Flask application as part of Homework 7 for SEAS-8405 Cybersecurity Architecture. The purpose of this exercise was to identify real-world security issues within a microservices-based web application and implement defenses that align with best practices and security architecture frameworks, including Defense in Depth (DiD), Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), and Adaptive Security Architecture (ASA).

This activity included the use of open-source security tools, container hardening, vulnerability scanning, and architecture design. All mitigation approaches were deployed in a layered and contextualized manner, designed to reduce the attack surface, apply least privilege, and strengthen system resilience. This report includes a thorough explanation of tools used, vulnerabilities discovered, remediations applied, architectural improvements, and key lessons learned.

>### Steps Taken

1. **Deployed the vulnerable Flask app using Docker Compose.**  
   The application was launched using `docker-compose up -d`, and containers started successfully.  
   The Flask app responded as expected at `localhost:15000`.

2. **Scanned the codebase using Bandit for known vulnerabilities.**  
   The Bandit static analysis tool identified unsafe subprocess calls, use of `eval()`, and insecure host bindings.

3. **Fixed hardcoded credentials, unsafe `eval()`, and missing input validations.**  
   Environment variables replaced hardcoded secrets, `eval()` was replaced with `sympy.sympify()` for safe math evaluation, and input validation was enforced using regex and type checks.

4. **Hardened the Dockerfile by using a minimal base image, creating a non-root user, and adding a HEALTHCHECK.**  
   The updated Dockerfile uses `python:3.13-alpine`, adds a non-root user, and includes a container health check.

5. **Updated `docker-compose.yml` with resource limits, read-only filesystem, and localhost port binding.**  
   Memory, process, and network restrictions were added to limit the blast radius of any compromise. Sensitive credentials were sourced securely from `.env` files.

6. **Restricted Flask to localhost** by explicitly setting `host='127.0.0.1'` in `app.py`, ensuring the application is only accessible from the host machine. This prevents external network access during development and meets secure deployment practices. Additionally, the Docker configuration binds the exposed port to localhost using `"127.0.0.1:15000:5000"` in `docker-compose.yml`, further reinforcing local-only access.


7. **Created a secure architecture diagram using draw.io.**  
   The architecture diagram was designed using [https://app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net) to visually represent security controls across the microservices deployment. It highlights container roles, Docker runtime protections, and network boundaries for defense-in-depth.

8. **Evaluated expression evaluation methods and implemented two secure versions.**  
   In the `after/` folder, I initially used `sympy.sympify()` to securely evaluate user-submitted math expressions. This method allowed safe arithmetic parsing (e.g., `2+3`, `4*(1+2)`) while blocking dangerous operations such as code execution or module imports.  

   I then tested the suggested method from the assignment `ast.literal_eval()` as a safer replacement for `eval()`. However, it cannot process math expressions like `2+3` because it only supports literal values such as numbers, lists, and strings—not arithmetic operations. When attempting to parse an expression like `2+3`, it raises a `ValueError` due to detecting an unsupported binary operation (`ast.BinOp`).

   To meet the assignment’s requirement while preserving math functionality, I created the `after2/` version using `ast.parse()` in `eval` mode, combined with a strict AST node validator. This solution securely parses and evaluates expressions by explicitly allowing only safe math operations, thus achieving both functionality and security without using `eval()` or `sympy.sympify()`.



>### Threat Modeling and Security Alignment

In order to ensure the Flask-based microservices application was resilient against common container threats, a structured threat modeling process was conducted using the STRIDE framework. Each threat category, Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege, was mapped to specific application behaviors and mitigated accordingly through code or container-level controls.

The model was extended with MITRE ATT&CK for Containers to identify real-world adversarial behaviors, such as container breakout attempts (T1611), user execution attacks (T1204), and implanting malicious images (T1525). Corresponding defenses were implemented using secure base images, read-only containers, strict input validation, and least privilege enforcement.

In addition, each discovered vulnerability was mapped to relevant NIST 800-53 controls to validate the remediation against industry standards. Examples include:
- **AC-6 / IA-5**: Enforced least privilege and proper credential handling  
- **SI-10 / SC-39**: Input validation to block command/code injection  
- **SC-12 / SC-28**: Protecting sensitive data at rest and in transit

The secure architecture diagram shown above (under steps taken, 6) visually reinforces this model by outlining privilege boundaries, container roles, and Docker hardening techniques such as `userns-remap`, `read_only`, `mem_limit`, and `no-new-privileges`.

>### Validation and Vulnerability Comparison

To confirm that the remediation efforts were effective, a set of before-and-after vulnerability scans were performed.

Docker Scout scans initially identified multiple vulnerabilities in the base image (`python:3.9-alpine`) and flagged insecure configurations. After refactoring the Dockerfile, switching to `python:3.13-alpine`, and locking down permissions and secrets, the image was rescanned.

The final scan returned **zero vulnerabilities**, confirming that hardening was successful and aligned with best practices for secure container development.

>### Architecture Improvements

**Before:** Flat architecture, root containers, no runtime checks.  
**After:** Layered defenses, non-root containers, hardened deployment.  
Mitigations applied addressed OWASP A1, A3, A5, and A7 vulnerabilities.  
*(OWASP, 2021)*

>### Lessons Learned

- Multi-layered defense is essential.  
- Static analysis is valuable for identifying hidden issues.  
- Small misconfigurations can have large impacts.  
- Automation must be combined with manual review.

>### Reflection and Framework Alignment

This hardening exercise directly reflects Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) principles, emphasizing secure design, static analysis, and verification steps integrated throughout the containerization workflow. Also, the multi-layered defenses deployed, input validation, non-root execution, and networking restriction—are aligned with core principles of Defense in Depth (DiD) and Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), enforcing least privilege and limiting trust boundaries.

>### Conclusion

This assignment provided in-depth, hands-on experience with applying modern container security techniques across the entire application lifecycle. By identifying vulnerabilities, implementing layered defenses, and validating remediations through automated tools and architecture design, it was possible to transform an insecure microservices deployment into a hardened, production-ready environment.

The final application now demonstrates improved resistance to code injection, privilege escalation, and remote exploitation. Security principles such as least privilege, network isolation, and input validation were enforced through both code and infrastructure-level controls. These changes not only addressed common OWASP Top 10 categories but also aligned with NIST 800-53 security controls and MITRE ATT&CK techniques relevant to containerized environments. This project also highlighted the importance of integrating security early in the development process, an essential component of secure DevSecOps pipelines. Writing an auto-hardening script emphasized the value of automation, but also the necessity of manual review and threat modeling to catch risks that scanners alone might miss.

Overall, the assignment strengthened my understanding of secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) principles, Defense in Depth (DiD), and Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA). These experiences will directly support my ability to design, assess, and secure real-world containerized systems in both academic and industry environments.
