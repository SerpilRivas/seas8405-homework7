## Incident Response Playbook: Potential DGA Domain Detected

**1. Triage:**

* **Step 1:** Verify Alert: Correlate the DGA alert from [Source - e.g., Splunk, SIEM] with other security tools (e.g., Zeek/Suricata logs for DNS queries to kq3v9z7j1x5f8g2h.info, EDR for process activity related to this domain).  Look for additional indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with the domain (e.g., malicious IP addresses,  compromised user accounts).
* **Step 2:** Investigate Domain Reputation: Query the domain against threat intelligence feeds (e.g., VirusTotal, PassiveTotal) to determine its reputation and any known malicious activity.
* **Step 3:** Assess Risk:  Consider the AI model confidence (59.65%) and contributing factors (high entropy favors DGA, length is less indicative).  While the confidence isn't overwhelmingly high, the high entropy warrants further investigation. Prioritize based on the overall threat landscape and potential impact.

**2. Containment:**

* **Step 1:** Block Domain: Implement immediate blocking of the domain 'kq3v9z7j1x5f8g2h.info' at the firewall (if applicable) and DNS level (using DNS sinkholing or a local DNS blocklist).
* **Step 2:** Isolate Affected Systems: If the domain is observed on specific endpoints, isolate them from the network to prevent further communication and lateral movement.  Identify these endpoints using EDR logs that show connections to this domain.
* **Step 3:** Network Segmentation:  Review network segmentation to identify and mitigate potential weaknesses allowing the compromise.

**3. Eradication & Recovery:**

* **Step 1:** Malware Analysis (if applicable): If endpoints communicating with the domain are identified, perform malware analysis on those systems.  Collect memory samples and disk images for offline analysis using tools like Volatility.
* **Step 2:** Endpoint Remediation: Initiate a full scan of affected endpoints with updated antivirus and EDR solutions.  Review and remove any detected malware. Investigate for persistence mechanisms (registry keys, scheduled tasks). Use EDR to examine processes and files associated with the domain.
* **Step 3:** System Restoration:  Consider restoring affected systems from a known good backup if malware eradication is unsuccessful or overly complex.

**4. Validation:**

* **Step 1:** Re-scan Systems: Perform a re-scan of all potentially affected systems with updated antivirus and EDR to ensure no malware remains.
* **Step 2:** Monitor Network Traffic:  Continuously monitor network traffic using Zeek/Suricata for any further attempts to access the blocked domain or similar suspicious activity.
* **Step 3:** Review Logs: Review Splunk, Zeek, Suricata and EDR logs to verify that the domain is no longer being accessed and that no further suspicious activity is occurring.

**5. Lessons Learned:**

* **Step 1:** Evaluate AI Model Performance: Analyze the AI model's performance in identifying DGAs and assess if any improvements are needed to improve accuracy and reduce false positives.
* **Step 2:**  Strengthen Security Controls:  Review and strengthen security controls, including network segmentation, firewall rules, and endpoint security, to prevent future similar incidents.
* **Step 3:** Improve Threat Intelligence:  Enhance threat intelligence gathering and integration to improve detection and response capabilities.
* **Step 4:** Update Playbook: Update this playbook based on the findings of this incident and any identified gaps in the response process.


**Note:** This playbook provides a general framework. Adapt specific steps based on your organization's infrastructure and security tools.  Remember to document all actions taken during the incident response process.
